      "full": "The Ifrit (Arabic: عفريت, 'ifrīt) is a powerful and typically malevolent class of jinn in Islamic tradition and Middle Eastern folklore. Created from smokeless fire like all jinn, Ifrits are among the most powerful types, known for their enormous strength, cunning intelligence, and tendency toward evil and rebellion. They appear as huge, winged, fiery beings in terrifying demonic form, though capable of shape-shifting. Possessing free will, Ifrits typically choose evil over good, though not universally. They wield superhuman strength, magic, fire manipulation, and flight. In the hierarchy of jinn, Ifrits are among the most powerful, below only Marids. They are mentioned in the Quran, where a powerful jinn (often interpreted as Ifrit) offers to serve King Solomon. Ifrits can grant wishes but in twisted, malevolent ways, serve sorcerers (dangerously), and destroy enemies. Defeating an Ifrit requires powerful magic or divine intervention. The concept remains active in Islamic and Arabic cultural traditions."
