## Overview

The **Ifrit** (Arabic: عفريت, *'ifrīt*) is a powerful and typically malevolent class of jinn in Islamic tradition and Middle Eastern folklore.

Created from **smokeless fire** like all jinn, Ifrits are among the most powerful types, known for their:
- Enormous strength and power
- Cunning intelligence
- Tendency toward evil and rebellion

## Islamic Theology

### Nature of Jinn

In Islamic belief:
- **Created from smokeless fire** (before humans, who were created from clay)
- **Possess free will** - can choose good or evil
- **Normally invisible** to humans unless choose to manifest
- **Subject to divine law** - accountable for their choices
- **Can be Muslim or non-Muslim** - have religious choices like humans

### Ifrit Specifically

**Nature**: Type of jinn that typically chooses evil and rebellion

**Free Will**: While usually malevolent, Ifrits possess free will - not universally evil

**Power**: Among the most powerful jinn, second only to Marids

**Alignment**: Rebellious, often in opposition to divine authority

---

## Quranic Mention

### Surah An-Naml (27:39)

> *"An Ifrit of the jinn said: 'I will bring it [the throne of the Queen of Sheba] to you before you rise from your place, and indeed, I am for this [task] strong and trustworthy.'"*

**Context**: This verse describes a powerful jinn (often interpreted as an Ifrit) offering to bring the Queen of Sheba's throne to King Solomon.

**Significance**:
- Demonstrates the power of jinn
- Shows Solomon's divinely-granted authority over jinn
- Illustrates Ifrit's strength and capability

**Note**: While the term "'ifrīt" appears in this verse, Islamic scholars have varying interpretations. The being is clearly a powerful jinn with extraordinary abilities.

## Respect & Cultural Sensitivity

### When Discussing Ifrit

**DO**:
- ✅ Recognize Islamic religious context
- ✅ Understand Quranic basis and theological significance
- ✅ Respect Arabic/Middle Eastern cultural origins

- ❌ Conflate with Western pop culture "genies"
- ❌ Trivialize or treat as mere entertainment
- ❌ Ignore Islamic theological context
- ❌ Sensationalize or stereotype Middle Eastern culture
- ❌ Appropriate for disrespectful creative use

## Western vs. Original Concept

### Divergence

**Islamic/Arabic Ifrit**:
- Powerful type of jinn
- Created from smokeless fire
- Free will, usually chooses evil
- Part of religious theology
- Terrifying, dangerous, rebellious

**Western "Genie"**:
- Wish-granting servant in lamp
- Comic or benevolent depiction
- Entertainment/fantasy
- Disconnected from religious context

**The Western "genie" is a significant departure from the original Islamic concept of Ifrit.**
